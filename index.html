							<h3 style='color: #9910d8;'></h3style> Mission Statement</h3>
							<h2>Written by <i class="fas fa-heart" style='color: #9910d8;'>~K</i> (Founder/CEO)</h2>
							<p></p> 
							<p> 							
								
								Our goal is awareness!
								
								Early Detection! Self Advocacy! To Erase Stigma, and "Chase".
								
								We are independent from Council, we are not experts, we are not from hospitals or care providers. No one can do this alone. I am thankful to have the group of Diverse Board Members of this Team on this journey.
								
								 Our Mission is to Fight for those who have fallen through the cracks. By "cracks", I mean the Red Tape, age, inaccessibility, inability due to no fault of their own, lack of quality care and compassion, years of stigma, misdiagnosis, and lack of answers. 
								
								In most cases, you decide what we do on your behalf.  We have a clear way of supporting people who cannot tell us what they want, to make sure their rights and interests are protected despite their age, background, ethnicity or religious belief. </p>
								
								<h2 style='color: #9910d8;'> How do we accomplish this?</h2> <p> We pledge Our moral compass to raise money, to effectively be able to "Chase" a need to afford some of the most basic items needed to bring some form of comfort to those who struggle everyday with a lack of basic items. Some examples of these items are scans not covered,  proper shoes, sheets, bedding, incontinence items, socks, bandages, medications, assistance to find the right resource programs for their specific need. As well as actively participating in Awareness programs and fundraisers,  This list is long. Especially when so many take needed items for granted daily.
								
								I (the Founder and CEO of "Chasing the Cure For All") personally pledge to actively seek out donations or item support from large corporations to ensure we can actively help as many as we can.
								
								
								We will work as hard as possible to bring awareness to early detection, accountability, inspiration, hope, to teach, navigate and to deploy "Chaser's" from the East Coast to the West Coast and from North to South with items to "Fill Cracks where we can".
								
								We have built a strong base of "CHASERS" ready to do their part for this Organization we call "Chasing The Cure For All" </p>
								 
								
								<p>Our goal is to build a network of Doctors, a team with like-minded Non Profit Organizations, advocates, resources and more to help as many as we can, so no one falls through the cracks of medical stigma anymore. We will utilize every resource we can to the best of our ability where we can.
								
								
								Sadly, we cannot build you a home, and we can not pay off all of your medical bills. We can't do everything for you. But we can be a hand to hold, a voice to help, and give comfort for you to know  "We see you and we hear you and you do matter! And we will provide some items of need for your journey.
								
								Medical stigma, suicides, and drug addictions are real. They come when we are lost for answers, confused by pages and pages of forms that are not always easy to understand or navigate. Depression sets in and soon we may find ourselves questioning; What am I fighting for? No one seems to really understand, hear or see me. While we may not be able to fix this for many, just one would be worth it to start.</p>
								
								<p>We are a "Grassroots" organization who are either living this medical nightmare day to day or a Member who has been directly affected by the same. We choose to do our best and become part of the solution instead of being part of the problem.
								
								We will not be the person with 5 plastic surgeries who has the $50 Million dollar home while the couple in the nosebleed seat don't even know how they're going to pay their electric bill that month.
								
								We will not be the "organization" that pays themselves 7 figures a year based on donations. 
								
								We will be the grains of sand, that grow to pebbles, that fuse into rocks, that grow into stones, that turn into Boulders which will begin building walls of HOPE.</p>
